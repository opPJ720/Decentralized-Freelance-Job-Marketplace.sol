# Decentralized Freelance Job Marketplace

## Project Description

The Decentralized Freelance Job Marketplace is a blockchain-based platform built on Ethereum that connects clients with freelancers in a trustless, transparent environment. This smart contract eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries by providing automated escrow services, dispute resolution mechanisms, and direct peer-to-peer transactions.

The platform enables clients to post jobs with locked funds, freelancers to submit competitive proposals, and facilitates secure payment release upon job completion. All transactions and interactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
